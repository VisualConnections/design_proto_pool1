Visual Connections is very pleased to design, develop, and deliver the prototype for this BPA IDIQ contract. We understand and align clearly with the objectives of GSA-18F for agile delivery services. We have the experience, maturity and the most qualified  resources to oï¬€er for this contract. The following paragraphs explain  the agile approach, processes,and technologies adopted for this approachThis prototype integrates with open FDA drugs data and demonstrates our capabilities in responsive user experience and delivers the prototype within the required  schedule. We treat responsive user experience as the end to end design rather than just the user interface. We believe responsive user experience as the integration of user interface, micro middleware services and flexible, scalable database.
We have conducted a 508 Compliance Review on the prototype and the prototype we are proposing is as Section 508 compliant as we are able to make it in the time allowed. We have the capacity to make the prototype completely compliant and we can do that once we have been awarded the contract.  
##**1. Methodology**
#####**a. Scrum Agile Approach:**
We are happy  to showcase our agile capabilities and process maturity for this prototype. Visual Connections treated this prototype as a real project and assigned the best of the processes and resources to the project.Visual Connections used Scrum Agile methodology to design, develop and test this prototype. We assigned roles for Product Owner, Scrum Master, Agile Coach, Technical Architect, User Experience expert, UI Developer, Software Programmer and Tester for our approach. We created a product backlog for the prototype requirement and features, which translated in to user stories. Since this is a very brief prototype,  we created  one sprint cycle  and  built most of the user stories. Noted below is the high level Scrum methodology  we utilized for this prototype

As part of the agile approach,  assigned points and user stories are also split in to multiple tasks. We included daily standups and user story level UI design reviews with the product owner to identify issues very early.We calculate daily points achievements and  updated the physical board. Following is our final burn down chart for the sprint 1 of our prototype.

#####**b. End User Centered Design Process**
Our team understands the importance to have iterative human centered design so we applied our proven methodology to involve end users during the design process. Noted below is the high level human centered approach we utlized for this prototype

Our process keeps the end users the center of our user design and our designer facilitated the design sessions, prototypes and dry runs with the end users. A key step in our process is defining the personas and user context walk-throughs before any designs start.  This ensures that we understand the end use needs and also understand learnability of the users for the designs. Main goal of our design process is to create a product which user can use with minimal effort to learn how to use it. We adopted initial wireframes and user walkthroughs of the wireframes of the key use cases from the design perspective. Once we finalized the initial wireframes, we created design prototypes based on the initial feedback.   

##**3. Benefits and Retrospective**
**Following are some of the benefits of our prototype approach:**
* We were able to successfully demonstrate our agile capabilities along with technical capabilities while adopting continuous integration with unit tests. This helped us identify defects early and reduce the reduced the need to fix* Our agile approach included user experience design which helped us to come up with UI design reviewed and developed quickly* We were able to prove our git and open source capabilities with tools and technology selection**Following are some of the areas of improvement for our prototype approach:**

* We would have demostrated our User Experience and Technology experience if we would have allocated more days
* Because of schedule restriction we executed only one sprint for the prototype
##**4. Installation Instructions**
* Install mongoDB using the instructions specified here 
	[Mongo DB ](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/)
	* Install node.js using the instructions specified here [node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/)
* Clone the git repository
* Run npm install from the base directory to install all the package dependencies
* Optional steps include integration with nginx (Open source http server), pm2 (Node.js process manager) and http proxy for node.js on nginx and opening the app on [Prototype](http://localhost)
